Hello! My name is Mary Elizabeth Habel, but I go by Meme. After recently completing my Master's in Business Analytics, I am currently in the market for a job in the Data Analytics and/or Data Science spaces. The 'About' page includes a brief history of my academic and professional experiences, along with skills I have gained along the way. On the 'Projects' page, you can see some of my work.
